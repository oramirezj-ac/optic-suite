# Optic-Suite

A web-based management suite for optometry clinics to handle patient records, prescriptions, and sales. This project is being built from the ground up to serve the real-world needs of an independent optometry practice.

## About The Project

`optic-suite` aims to be a comprehensive, yet intuitive, web application that streamlines the daily operations of an optometry practice. It is designed to replace paper-based records with a secure and efficient digital system.

The core goal is to manage the entire patient journey, from the initial clinical examination to the final sale and lab order, providing a centralized source of information for optometrists.

### Key Features (Planned)

* **Patient Clinical Records:** Track patient history, pre-existing conditions, and visual acuity over time.
* **Prescription Management:** Store and manage detailed prescription data, including autorefractor, lensometer, and final subjective results.
* **Sales & Lab Orders:** Generate sales invoices, manage payments, and create orders for external labs.
* **Pricing Calculator:** An integrated tool to help calculate final product prices based on frames, lenses, and treatments.

## Built With

This project is being developed using a classic and robust web stack, focusing on reliability and control.

* **Backend:** PHP
* **Database:** MariaDB
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code, Git & GitHub

## Documentation

The entire development process, from initial planning to final implementation, is being documented using **Obsidian**. This serves as a project knowledge base, tracking design decisions, database schemas, and future ideas.
